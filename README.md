Description:

This project allows users to generate a customized multiplication table by entering

minimum and maximum values for both rows and columns. It uses Jquaery plug in validation to enter validations before any event action happens. Linking all files together to get a working multiplication table.preventing any corrupted files due bad imputs is important. Jquery syntax is a little difficult but shorter than vanilla javascript.
